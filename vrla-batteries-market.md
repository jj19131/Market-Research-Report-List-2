<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VRLA Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbed Glass Mat Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VRLA batteries refer to valve-regulated lead-acid batteries, which are maintenance-free and sealed. There are two main types of VRLA batteries - Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) battery and Gel battery. AGM batteries have glass fibers woven into a mat to absorb the electrolyte, providing better resistance to vibration and shock. Gel batteries, on the other hand, use silica to create a gel-like electrolyte, offering better performance in deep discharge cycles. Both types are commonly used in applications where maintenance is a concern.</p></p>
