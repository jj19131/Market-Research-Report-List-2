<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shaft Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible Couplings</li><li>Rigid Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shaft couplings are crucial components in machinery used to connect two shafts together for transmitting power. Flexible couplings allow for some degree of misalignment between shafts and can dampen vibrations, while rigid couplings provide a more secure and precise connection but do not accommodate misalignment. Both types have their own market segments based on the specific requirements of the machinery being used. Flexible couplings are popular in industries where vibrations and misalignments are common, while rigid couplings are preferred in applications where precision and rigidity are crucial.</p></p>
