<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic Shock Absorber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Active Shock Absorber</li><li>Semi-Active Shock Absorber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromagnetic shock absorbers are categorized into two main types: pure active shock absorbers and semi-active shock absorbers. Pure active shock absorbers continuously adjust damping rates in response to road conditions and driver inputs, providing optimal control and comfort. Semi-active shock absorbers, on the other hand, have variable damping rates that can be adjusted electronically but are not continuously adaptive. Both types offer improved ride quality and handling compared to traditional passive shock absorbers, making them popular choices in the automotive industry.</p></p>
