<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Insulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Suspension Glass Insulators</li><li>Pin Glass Insulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Glass Insulators market consists of two main types: Suspension Glass Insulators and Pin Glass Insulators. Suspension Glass Insulators are designed to support power lines and are hung from structures using strings or cables. They provide insulation and prevent electricity from flowing into the supporting structure. On the other hand, Pin Glass Insulators are mounted directly on poles or towers to support power lines. They also provide insulation and protection against electrical discharge. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of power transmission systems.</p></p>
