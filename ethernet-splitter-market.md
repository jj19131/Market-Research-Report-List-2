<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethernet Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ethernet splitters are devices used to split a single Ethernet connection into multiple connections. There are two main types of Ethernet splitters in the market: passive and active. Passive splitters do not require external power and simply divide the signal between devices. Active splitters, on the other hand, require power to regenerate and boost the signal, allowing for longer cable runs and better performance. Both types cater to different connectivity needs and are popular choices in networking setups.</p></p>
