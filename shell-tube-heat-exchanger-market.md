<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shell & Tube Heat Exchanger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross Flow to Tubes</li><li>Parallel Flow to Tubes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers are classified based on the flow of fluid inside the tubes in relation to the flow of the fluid inside the shell. In Cross Flow to Tubes market, the fluid inside the tubes flows perpendicular to the fluid inside the shell, promoting efficient heat transfer. On the other hand, in Parallel Flow to Tubes market, the fluid inside the tubes and shell flows in the same direction, which may not be as efficient in heat transfer compared to Cross Flow design.</p></p>
