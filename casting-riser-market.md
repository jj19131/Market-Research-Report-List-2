<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casting Riser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Blind Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Casting risers are used in metal casting to prevent shrinkage cavities by providing additional molten metal to the casting as it cools. There are two main types of casting risers: Open Type and Blind Type. Open Type risers are exposed on the surface of the mold, allowing for easy visualization and removal after solidification. Blind Type risers, on on the other hand, are enclosed within the mold cavity and are not visible from the outside. Both types serve the same purpose of providing additional molten metal to the casting.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Casting Riser Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exothermic Riser</li><li>Insulating Riser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Casting risers are used in metal casting to prevent shrinkage defects in the final product. Exothermic risers release heat as they solidify, providing additional feeding material to the casting. Insulating risers, on the other hand, retain heat for a longer period of time, allowing for extended feeding of the casting. Both types of risers are essential in ensuring a successful casting process by preventing defects and ensuring the quality of the final product.</p></p>
